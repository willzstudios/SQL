# SQL

Learning SQL.
Why do so many companies require SQL.

Why can't we all just use Microsoft Excel.
Apparently SQL databases can handle a LOT more data, faster and more efficiently than Excel can.

Good for speed, and big data. but might be hard for common folk to learn how to get data from these SQL databases.
Then there are "tools" and IDEs that can help common folk easily obtain data from SQL databases.

that's all I know for now.
