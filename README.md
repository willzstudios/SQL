# SQL
## 20210720 - Learning SQL
- Why do so many companies require SQL?
- What is SQL?
- Why can't we all just use Microsoft Excel instead of SQL databases?
- In what scenario/case is SQL useful?

SQL is Structured-Query-Language, a programming language designed for managing data within relational database management systems. Originally developed by IBM in the 1970s.   

In the late 1970s, Relational Software, Inc (now Oracle Corporation) saw the potential of SQL and developed their own SQL (Oracle PL/SQL). Now there are many different versions of SQL, Eg. Microsoft's T-SQL.

Apparently SQL databases can handle a LOT more data, faster and more efficiently than Excel can.

Good for speed, and big data. but might be hard for common folk to learn how to get data from these SQL databases.
Then there are "tools" and IDEs that can help common folk easily obtain data from SQL databases.

that's all I know for now.

My resource for learning will be:

- and good ol Google

**Things I've learnt so far:**
- "--" is how you make notes for a single line
- "/*"... notes in here ..."/\*" is how you make multi-line notes, just like C#


Predefined datatypes in SQL
- Character (can't store Unicode characters)
- National character (can store Unicode characters - and apparently takes up more room sometimes)
- Binary
- Numeric
- Datetime
- Interval
- Boolean
- XML (information wrapped in eXtensible Markup Language tags - kinda like HTML - bit harder to read than JSON, but can do a lot more?)
- JSON (Javascript Object Notation - is a text format for storing/transporting data - easily readable)
